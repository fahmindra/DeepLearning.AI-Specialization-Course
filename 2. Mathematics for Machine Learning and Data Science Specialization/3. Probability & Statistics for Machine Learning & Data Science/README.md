# Probability & Statistics for Machine Learning & Data Science
After completing this course, learners will be able to:

- Describe and quantify the uncertainty inherent in predictions made by machine learning models, using the concepts of probability, random variables, and probability distributions.
- Visually and intuitively understand the properties of commonly used probability distributions in machine learning and data science like Bernoulli, Binomial, and Gaussian distributions
- Apply common statistical methods like maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and maximum a priori estimation (MAP) to machine learning problems
- Assess the performance of machine learning models using interval estimates and margin of errors 
- Apply concepts of statistical hypothesis testing to commonly used tests in data science like AB testing
