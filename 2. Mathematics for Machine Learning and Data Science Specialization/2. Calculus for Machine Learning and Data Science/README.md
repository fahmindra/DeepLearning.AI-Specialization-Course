# Calculus for Machine Learning and Data Science
After completing this course, learners will be able to:
- Analytically optimize different types of functions commonly used in machine learning using properties of derivatives and gradients 
- Approximately optimize different types of functions commonly used in machine learning using first-order (gradient descent) and second-order (Newtonâ€™s method) iterative methods
- Visually interpret differentiation of different types of functions commonly used in machine learning
- Perform gradient descent in neural networks with different activation and cost functions
