# Linear Algebra for Machine Learning and Data Science
After completing this course, learners will be able to:

- Represent data as vectors and matrices and identify their properties using concepts of singularity, rank, and linear independence, etc.
- Apply common vector and matrix algebra operations like dot product, inverse, and determinants 
- Express certain types of matrix operations as linear transformations 
- Apply concepts of eigenvalues and eigenvectors to machine learning problems
